## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ritik4ever/crypto-travel.git
cd crypto-travel
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. The page will reload when you make changes, and lint errors will appear in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance. The build is minified and filenames include hashes.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need to customize the build configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This copies all configuration files and dependencies into your project for full control.
